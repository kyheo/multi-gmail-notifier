USAGE
=====
1- Run gmail-notifier-settings.py
   It will ask for the username (full address ex: foo@gmail.com or for hosted
   emails sites, foo@bar.com), the homepage for that user (where you login into
   the account, http://www.gmail.com or http://webmail.bar.com) and then it
   will ask for the password.
   Don't get scared, the password is stored in the keyring manager.

   Configuration, username and homepage, is stored in
   ~/.config/gmail-notifier/settings.conf

   Repeat this step for each account you have.

2- Run gmail-notifier.py
   It will check every 5 minutes for new email in the configured accounts, and
   notify in the indicator applet and with a notification bubble if there are
   new emails.

   The indicator will show an application label (Kyheo Gmail Notifier) and each
   account with the number of unread emails.

   If a notification was raised, then the account with new emails is flagged
   with and * as a prefix.

   Clicking on an account will open the homepage in the default webbrowser.

   To silent all the notifications, a click in the app label (Kyheo Gmail
   Notifier) is enough.
