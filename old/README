DESCRIPTION
===========
Application to check if there are new emails in the GMail accounts, and notifies
the user by using the new indicators.


PYTHON REQUIREMENTS
===================
feedparser, urllib2, base64, indicate, gnomekeyring, gobject, gtk, indicate, 
pynotify, pygtk, pango


USAGE
=====
1- Run multi-gmail-notifier-settings.py
   It will pop-up a gtk application (my first one) and in there you will be able
   to add, modify and delete users.
   All the information is stored in the gnome-keyring application (seahorse), so
   no need for extra files.
   The username should be the one you use in the login page with the @domain
   part, and the url, must be the full url in where you log in.

   Ex:
   - Regular gmail account
   user: your.name@gmail.com
   pass: ######
   uri : http://www.gmail.com

   - Own domain gmail account
   user: your.name@yourdomain.com
   pass: ######
   uri : http://webmail.yourdomain.com

2- Run multi-gmail-notifier.py
   It will check every 5 minutes for new email in the configured accounts, and
   notify in the indicator applet and with a notification bubble if there are
   new emails.

   The indicator will show an application label (Multi Gmail Notifier) and each
   account with the number of unread emails.

   If a notification was raised, then the account with new emails is flagged
   with and * as a prefix.

   Clicking on an account will open the homepage in the default webbrowser.

   To silent all the notifications, a click in the app label (Multi Gmail
   Notifier) is enough.
